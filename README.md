# Language Specs

This is a collection of code examples. It's great for testing syntax highlighting when creating a theme.

Each language file should include the following sections:

#### 1. Example

An example of a language. Its purpose is to show a typical use case and get a quick overall impression.


#### 2. Tests

Various tests. It doesn't have to test every possibility, more like 1-2 of each "group". And maybe a few edge cases.


## Contributing

If there is a language that isn't included or not complete, your contribution is highly appreciated. Thanks.
