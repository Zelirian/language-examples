# Language Examples

This is a collection of language examples. It's great for testing syntax highlighting when creating a theme.

Each language file comes with two sections:

#### 1. Simple example

A simple example of the language. Its purpose is to show a typical use case and get a quick overall impression.


#### 2. More tests

If needed more examples or tests can be added. Or maybe show a few edge cases.
